# 100 Days Of ML Code - Progress Report

## Day 1 : Jul 6 , 2018

**What I Learned** : Learned One Hot Encoding using sklearn.

**What I Implemented** : Implemented One Hot Encoding and Rock - Mine Prediction Problem (DataSet Source - Kaggle). Getting **ERROR** Attempting to use uninitialized value Variable even after using **sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())** 


**Link of Work:** [Commit](https://github.com/Swapnil7711/100DaysOfMLCode/tree/master/Day%201)

## Day 2 : Jul 7 , 2018

**What I Learned** : Brushed up Maths behind Gradient Descent Algorithm, learned how to save model using Tensorflow and also learned that adding more nodes to layer does not make your model more accurate. We need to tune the parameters to get more accurate result. 

**What I Implemented** : Solved Errors from Day 1. Trained Neural Network and saved Rock-Mine Prediction Model.

## Day 3 : Jul 8 , 2018

**What I Learned** : Learned about Data Cleaning. But I feel I need to learn more about data cleaning. 

**What I Implemented** : Tried to clean and analyse two datasets. Cleaned data and Implemented House Price Prediction Kaggle problem.

## Day 4 : Jul 9 , 2018

**What I Learned** : Learned more about Data Cleaning. Learned to handle Categorical and numerical value in Dataset.

**What I Implemented** : Cleaned few more dataset. Implemented Titanic Kaggle Project. Tried to implement House Price Prediction Problme with Tensorflow and Neural Network, getting few erros.

## Day 5 : Jul 10 , 2018

**What I Learned** : More about Data cleaning and feature extraction and its implementation.

**What I Implemented** : Implemented full project of DrivenData Pump it Up: Data Mining the Water Table.

**Link of Work:** [Link](https://github.com/Swapnil7711/100DaysOfMLCode/tree/master/Day%205)

## Day 6 : Jul 11 , 2018

**What I Learned** : Importance of Feature Scaling.

**What I Implemented** : Tried to implement yesterdays project with Neural Network using Tensorflow spent entire day trying figure out single error. Still not getting high accuracy result. Need to Learn Parameter tuning.

**What I Implemented** : Implemented DrivenData Warm Up: Predict Blood Donations. 

## Day 09 : Jul 14 , 2018

**What I Learned** : Learned sklearn functions from youtube.

**What I Implemented** : Started new project from Kaggle. 

## Day 10 : Jul 14 , 2018

**What I Learned** : .

**What I Implemented** : Still Working on same project.
