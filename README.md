# 100 Days Of ML Code - Progress Report

## Day 1 : Jul 6 , 2018

**What I Learned** : Learned One Hot Encoding using sklearn.

**What I Implemented** : Implemented One Hot Encoding and Rock - Mine Prediction Problem (DataSet Source - Kaggle). Getting **ERROR** Attempting to use uninitialized value Variable even after using **sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())** 


**Link of Work:** [Commit](https://github.com/Swapnil7711/100DaysOfMLCode/tree/master/Day%201)

## Day 2 : Jul 7 , 2018

**What I Learned** : Brushed up Maths behind Gradient Descent Algorithm, learned how to save model using Tensorflow and also learned that adding more nodes to layer does not make your model more accurate. We need to tune the parameters to get more accurate result. 

**What I Implemented** : Solved Errors from Day 1. Trained Neural Network and saved Rock-Mine Prediction Model.

## Day 3 : Jul 8 , 2018

**What I Learned** : Learned about Data Cleaning. But I feel I need to learn more about data cleaning. 

**What I Implemented** : Tried to clean and analyse two datasets. Cleaned data and Implemented House Price Prediction Kaggle problem.

## Day 4 : Jul 9 , 2018

**What I Learned** : Learned more about Data Cleaning. Learned to handle Categorical and numerical value in Dataset.

**What I Implemented** : Cleaned few more dataset. Implemented Titanic Kaggle Project. Tried to implement House Price Prediction Problme with Tensorflow and Neural Network, getting few erros.
